    <p>
      Computer Science student at UCD while learning on
      the side by completing my own projects & getting as much experience as possible.
      I am always looking out for opportunities to better prepare myself to embark on a
      fantastic career in software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have completed work experience with the
      Engineering Services team at Qualtrics & this summer I am looking forward to a 3 month
      internship with Calypso AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also very involved in the community within UCD. I am a committee member for UCD Netsoc
      (2nd year on the committee), I mentor children learning to code for UCD CoderDojo & play ultimate
      frisbee with the UCD Mens Development squad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strongly believe that there is always something you can learn about for your own self-improvement. Hence,
      I am always toying around with something new on the side, while practicing towards mastery in what I have learned so far.
